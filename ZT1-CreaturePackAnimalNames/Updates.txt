 ANIMAL LOCALIZATION CHANGE:
 ======
 
 I have changed the following Localization line: animalWolfhound,entityclasses,Entity,Hound
 
 I have decided to change the name of "animalWolfhound" from "Wolf Hound" to "Hound." Just a personal choice to make it less specific and maybe more immersive?

 ANIMAL LOCALIZATION CHANGES:
 ======
 
 I have added a localization for "animalBloatfly" and set it to "Bloatfly." Mod author wrathmaniac pointed out to me that I hadn't included this animal localization in the pack.
 
 I have added the following localizations related to "Snow Swarm" creature and miscellaneous UI descriptions per findings by wrathmaniac:
 
 buffSnowSwarm = "You are inside a snow storm, take cover or you may get frost bite!"
 buffFrostbiteDesc = "Minor frostbite will reduce your stamina, stay out of snow storms to avoid a severe case of frostbite."
 buffFrostbiteTooltip = You have minor frostbite.
 buffFrostbite2Desc = You have severe frostbite!
 buffFrostbite2Tooltip = "You have severe frostbite, you health gain is reduced by 50%!"

 FoodChangeOT = Food Loss Over-Time
 FoodLossPerStaminaPointGained = Food Loss Per Stamina Gain
 
 I have changed localization's for 2 different pre-existing animals via some suggestions from mod author wrathmaniac. See the changes below:
 
 In v1.2:
 animalSpider01 = Spider
 animalSpider03 = Spider
 
 In v1.3.0:
 animalSpider01 = Young Spider
 animalSpider03 = Hunter Spider
