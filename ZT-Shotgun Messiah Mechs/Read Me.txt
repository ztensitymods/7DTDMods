 Shotgun Messiah Mechs - Version 1.3.0
 Select A19.3 Patches That Rename Zombies, Animals, Machines & More!
 Introduction to Shotgun Messiah's Failed Commission
 
 
 ABOUT THIS MOD
 ==============
 
 This is a modlet that was originally built off the premise of Vanilla Creature Renaming and it's original iteration was designed to solely rename creatures. Instead of targeting vanilla creature names, this modlet targeted creatures added by Xyth's Creature Mechs Pack.
 
 Now, this is a modlet that not only renames six mechs from Xyth's Creature Pack Mechs, but it also doubles the health for select bots, making them bosses, changes the name of the mod from Creature Pack Mechs Renaming to Shoutgun Messiahs Mechs, creates lore for the mechs and sets up for more potential expansive updates in the future.
 
 When using a health bar, such as Sirillion's SMX Series and it's optional Target Health Bar modlet, Khaine's HP Bars or KonradSB's Hit Bar Health Bar, players will now have immersive names for animals added by this modlet.
 
 
 LORE
 =======
 
 Months before the zombie apocalypse took over the world and much of the human population with it, titan company Shotgun Messiah was doing everything it could to thrive as a company, survive and ward off the undead. To this end, they commissioned six different mechs as a last resort to protect their company, their assets and maybe their employees if they were lucky.
 
 Despite their efforts, it seemed for naught, as they clearly failed with a multitude of zombies taking over the world, some of which have gone way beyond decaying and radiation to this day. Now, months if not years after it all started the ones that survived are starting to see machines that fight like us, but the thing is? They're coming after us.
 
 Whatever Shotgun Messiah's CEOs had commissioned, they are starting to break free from what we can only assume are the factories. We have yet to confirm how they are getting out, but just when we thought the walkers were too much to handle, now this shit is kicking our ass.
 
 
 REQUIREMENTS
 =======
 
 Most builds of 7 Days to Die should be acceptable, however the most recent build of the game is recommended, which is currently v19.3.
 
 You will however absolutely require a health bar mod in order for this mod to make an effect on your game, otherwise you simply won't see the changes. You will have to pick one of three health bars currently available by mod authors Sirillion, Khaine and KonradSB.

 To have the same UI, health bar, etc. as found in this modlet's showcase images, you must install Sirillion's SMX series and the accompanying Target Health Bar that is an optional download either through the launcher or via Nexus.

 FEATURES
 =======
 
 All robots needing renamed from name type similar to "mechBee" have been replaced with an immersive counterpart. Specifically, there are six different mechanical entities that are added to the game by Xyth's pack from robots and drones to spheres.
 
 Health bars have been increased for two different mechs to reflect their new boss statuses as they look a little more dangerous than their counterpart. For "mechRobotArmy," the new HP max is 800 and for "mechSphereII," the HP max is 900.
 
 
 MECH RENAMES
 =======
 
 mechBee = SGM Bee
 mechDrone = Shotgun Messiah Drone
 mechRobot = Rogue Messiah Bot
 mechRobotArmy = Shotgun Messiah Boss
 mechSphereI = Messiah's Mecha Claw
 mechSphereII = Messiah's Claw Boss

 SHOTGUN MESSIAHS MECHS' FUTURE
 =======
 
 The idea to create lore for the mechs surrounding Shotgun Messiah because I was trying to think of what companies are prevalent in the vanilla game. I decided that this company was the most prevalent in terms of being one of the only POIs in the game with a factory big enough to potentially house some of these mechs and it gave me the idea that maybe they were one companies that would be the richest and therefore most capable of commissioning these guys.
 
 For the future, I plan to work on implementing a way to make all, some combination or very specific mechs to spawn at the Shotgun Messiah Factories and/or Shotgun Messiah shops (SGM Bee, Rogue Messiah Bot and maybe Messiah's Mecha Claw as examples).
 
 Mod author mentioned that potentially implementing quests would go well with the lore created for the mechs and I don't disagree. So that could be in the works in the long haul. However, that for now, will be put on the back burner.
 
 NOTES
 =======
 
 I plan to eventually work on renaming modlets for Xyth's Community Project "1-NPCPackAnimals," "1-NPCPackHumans" and "1-NPCPackMechs." However, due to complications currently with sphereii's "NPC Dialog Windows" and "0-SpherellCore," I put my experimental modlets on the backburner. 
 
 Mod author sphereii has stated that a planned update for both "winterween" and "0-SpherellCore" is in the works to hopefully be pushed by A19.3. For now, I will wait for that update to be released before tackling renaming NPCs of any kind.
 
 
 SHOUT OUTS
 =======
 
 If it wasn't for discussion, guidance and help getting started from other mod authors in Guppy's Discord like wrathmaniac, TSPBX, Xyth, Mumpfy, sphereii, Sirillion, saminal, Khaine, chiko and Guppy himself, none of this would have been possible.
 
 
 CREDITS
 =======
 
 None of Xyth's Creature Packs would be possible either if it wasn't for the hard work and communication of this powerful modding community. 
 
 Primarily, I want to give an extra thank you to not only Xyth, but also DarkStarDragon, Guppycur and TSBX for work on the zombies, Robeloto for work on Spider sounds, Mumpfy for work on re-texturing and new asset creation, and XML work by Kergan, SaltyAF and Chikorina (Chiko).
