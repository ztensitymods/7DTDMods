    <Description value="Add-on to Xyth's 'Creature Pack Mechs' that renames mechs, adjusts bot health and establishes lore." />
	<!-- This is a modlet that renames six mechs from Xyth's Creature Pack Mechs and doubles the health for select bots, making them bosses. As one of the next iterations of what was previously titled Creature Pack Mechs Renaming, ZT-Shoutgun Messiah Mechs seeks to establish new lore surrounding six mechs that were commissioned by the titan company months before the zombie apocalyse.-->
