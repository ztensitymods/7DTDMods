 Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive - Version 3.0.0
 The Unnecessary But Beautiful 20.3 Rebuild
 Updates Log 3.0.0
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 1.2.0 -
 ==============
 
 BEDROLL FEATURE:
 =======

 Added bedroll features to three beds added by UBBI. Specifically, players will now be able utilize the big bed and small bed from the Bedroom Furniture set and the Garden Bed from the Pool/Outdoor Furniture recipes.

 
 LIGHT FEATURE ADDED TO THREE PRE-EXISTING ITEMS:
 =======

 Added light feature, which allows players to turn the light on/off using a wire tool, to the bathroom shelf and small bathroom sink (from the Bathroom Furniture/Amenities recipe) and the swimming pool light (from the Pool/Outdoor Furniture recipe).
 
 
 TWEAKED SWIMMING POOL BLOCK PROPERTIES:
 =======

 Properties of all four swimming pool blocks should now match concrete a little closer for what is required to repair these objects and what you can retrieve when destroying the objects.

 
 UPDATED FLOOR LAMP TEXTURES:
 =======

 Cleaned the floor lamp texture and made sure the brightness was still the same as before. Most importantly, the aesthetic of the floor lamp now streamlines with the rest of the lamps in UBBI.
 

 UPDATED SMALL LAMP LIGHT:
 =======
 
 Reworked the small lamp so it's light was working like the rest of the lights, as expected.
 
 
 UPDATED RECIPE ORDERING:
 =======

 Added shower glass pieces to the Bathroom Furniture/Amenities recipe so that it's easier to find them, making things also a little more seamless when building bathrooms, restrooms, shower houses etc.
 
 Also added items that now work as lights into the Lights recipe to make it easier to find them, along with re-ordering a few miscellaneous items for better consistency.
 

 UPDATED LOCALIZATION:
 =======
 
 Tweaked multiple blocks in the Localization.xml that have words that make a little more sense.
 
 
 - "Sofa Pieces" recipe has been changed to "Sofa Furniture" and it's description has been edited to say "Sofa furniture for the zombie apocalypse!"
 
 - "Pool Light Blocks" has been changed to "Swimming Pool Light."

 - One of the bathroom cabinets was titled "cabinet," but is now titled "Small Bathroom Sink."

 - "Lamp" has been changed to "Small Lamp."
 

 UPDATED LOADING BUNDLE FIX:
 =======

 In an effort to help with FPS, potential freezing etc. for players running on older software/hardware, an items XML has been added to pre-load select bundles into memory.
 
 Currently bundles that include ten or more blocks (i.e. garden bed/pool items, windows, bathroom amenity items, various doors, sofa furniture and cabinets) are being pre-loaded in addition to lights, TVs and electronics/tech, which includes a fireplace, a laptop, a PC, a sound bar and a sound file.
 
 Hopefully, this XML will allow for slightly smoother gameplay for players.
 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 1.2.5 -
 ==============
 
 URGENT FIX TO PERK REQUIREMENTS:
 =======
 
 I was unaware that by putting various lights under master blocks it created a loophole, which allowed for select lights to still be crafted despite not having the correct perks assigned. This was resolved by removing lights from different recipe blocks and only having them under one recipe block ("HN Lights" or "Lights").
 
 
 LIGHTS ARE NOW UNLOCKABLE BY FINDING THE "BASICS OF ELECTRICITY SCHEMATIC:"
 =======
 
 Lights can now be unlocked before hitting the appropriate perks if you are lucky enough to find the "basics of electricity schematic" either through the trader or out in the world on your travels. With the help of modder Beardman, he designed the xpath which allowed for this schematic to become unlockable.
 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 1.2.6 -
 ==============
 
 URGENT FIX TO Floor Lamp:
 =======
 
 I was testing War3zuk's overhaul when I discovered the lamp's light feature wasn't working. This update fixes that.
 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 1.2.7 -
 ==============
 
 URGENT FIX TO Floor Lamp, Small Lamp & PC:
 =======
 
 I was testing Ravenhearst's overhaul when I discovered the small lamp's light feature wasn't working again. This time, I went into Unity and really dug deeper and was seeing what was happening. Turns out I had been using the same animator file for two different objects, which would essentially toggle one of the features off when I corrected the other and vise versa. This update now fixes both lights. I also made the texture on the PC unlit so it would be brighter and not get dimmed out. This only seemed to happen on Ravenhearst's mod, but it should have been like this from the start.
 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 1.2.8 -
 ==============
 
 READ ME ADJUSTMENT:
 ======
 
 Adjusted text from A19.2b4 or 19.2b4 to 19.3.
 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 1.3.0 -
 ==============
 
 ITEM HP ADJUSTMENTS:
 ======
 
 I have adjusted HP values of all blocks in XML to match more closely with their item counterpart in-game, so that they are a little more immersive. This way when breaking items from doors, windows, cabinets and umbrella stands (now made out of iron) to tables, chairs and paintings amongst others, their health is not only balanced, but also a little more realistic across the board.
 
 For Example: The "Bulletproof Mirrored Doors" now has 750 health, rather than the previously, unrealistically, high health of 3000.
 
 
 PROPERTY ADJUSTMENTS:
 ======
 
 I have adjusted properties of all blocks in XML to match more closely with their item counterpart in-game for further increased immersion. 
 
 This means that when hitting items either with fists, a tool or a weapon, the item has affects that appear closer to what they are (i.e. something made out of wood will now look like it's wood being hit instead of iron) and you will now receive ingredients/resources in return when destroyed this way (in most cases the ingredients will be what was used for the recipe and then a certain percentage of what that ingredient returned).
 
 This also means that if an item drops when placed, you now have a chance to receive a certain amount of ingredients/resources back in return (in most cases the ingredients will be what was used for the recipe and then a certain percentage of what that ingredient returned).
 
 
 DESTROYING/DISSASEMBLING:
 ======
 
 To add additional immersion, players can now use the wrench line of tools to break down select items from Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive after being placed. The items that can be returned follow in-line not only with vanilla counterparts, but also with select ingredients required to make the recipes in the first place. 
 
 You can still use your fists and/or standard weapons to break items down to receive wood, iron etc. but you won't get additional resources/ingredients returned that you otherwise would if you used a tool from the wrench line.
 
 
 Wrench Line: Wrench, Ratchet & Impact Tool
 
 UBBI Items Available to Disassemble: Sinks (6), Lights (10), Doors (10), Beds (3), Closet Pieces (3), Fireplace, Sound Bar, TVs (4), PC, Laptop, PlayStation 4 Console, Bathtubs (2), a Cooktop, a Fridge, a Gas Stove, a Wall Oven, a Kitchen Cooktop, a Toaster, a Coffee Maker and a Microwave.
 
 
 ITEM REPAIR ADJUSTMENTS:
 ======
 
 I have adjusted the resource requirement to repair an assortment of items across the board in the blocks XML. There are still a wide variety of items that require things like Forged Iron and Wood to repair, however there are also many items that now require new resources to repair.
 
 
 Resource Repair Master List: Cloth Fragment, Concrete Mix, Forged Iron, Glass Block, Leather & Wood
 
 The Item Repair Atlas include more information as to what item requires what for repair.
 
 
 CREATIVE MENU / CRAFTING TABS REORDERING:
 ======
 
 I have reordered/recategorized recipes in the crafting tabs so that players can now better find recipes in either the building category, science category and/or the decor/miscellaneous category when at the workbench instead of having to manually search for "HN" or the name of the recipe such as "lights."
 
 
 I have also made sure to add an ordering property to all blocks, to make sure that blocks can be found accordingly in the creative menu "building" / "floot" area. 
 
 
 DECORATIONS CHANGE / ITEM RETURN BEHAVIOR CHANGE:
 ======
 
 All decorations in-game can still be picked up, however if destroyed by a player's fists or a weapon they cannot be retrieved like before and will instead provide a player with a certain percentage of select ingredients/resources back in return. Alternatively, if any decoration were to fall right after being placed, resources would similarly return to the player.
 
 
 Any item like the bathroom towel or bathroom toilet paper that would return to a players inventory after being destroyed like before, will now no longer do that. Instead, a percentage of ingredients/resources are returned to the player instead. This is done to increase immersion and simply makes more sense.
 
 
 LOCALIZATION & RECIPE ORDERING CHANGES:
 ======
 
 I have changed localizations of an assortment of items in-game to increase immersion. Many changes have applied to select tables, sliding glass doors, standard doors and a few more.
 
 
 I have also changed the order of glass doors, shower doors and shower glass to be together so that they can be found quicker and more efficiently when flowing through the windows pages.
 
 
 BLOCKS ROTATIONS:
 ======
 
 Every item should now be able to rotate by every type of rotation thanks to the suggestion and help from LeonaLens and Bdubyah. This has been achieved by adding the "<property name="AllowAllRotations" value="true"/> line of code to each master block that controls the recipes.
 
 
 BEHIND THE SCENES:
 ======
 
 Finally, I have done a multitude of tweaks to the code, which has done almost nothing but make things easier for future updates. The following updates will not be noticeable to players, but did occur to make 1.3.0 a reality:
 
 
 Reordered blocks.xml to match their Master List blocks ordering to make future updates a little easier. To this end, I have also reordered the individual blocks throughout each category to match their "Place Alt Block Value" organization so that tweaking properties would be easier now and later.
 
 
 I have also reordered recipes.xml to match blocks.xml ordering so that each recipe would be in the same exact order as in the blocks.xml. This achieves likely nothing, but my personal OCD needs, potentially future updates and maybe even helps to separate UBBI from Hernan's original UBB.
 
 
 
 More than ever, Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive (UBBI) is a comprehensive rebuild that stands further from Hernan's version than any previous version. Update 1.3.0 is likely the last major tweak to blocks.xml, as I truly took a deep dive into the code, changing multiple lines, removing some and adjusting others.
 
 Future updates should be easier and quicker however moving forward.
 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 2.0.0 -
 ==============
 
 NEW REQUIREMENTS & CURRENT SAVE GAME WARNING:
 ======
 
 This version of UBBI's 2.0.0 update is designed only for the vanilla version of 7 Days to Die. Meaning if you have SMX UI or another mod that alters the campfire UI winodow and xui, this modlet will conflict, as the added appliances tweak this part of the UI.
 
 Before loading up UBBI 2.0.0 in a current save, all following items should be destroyed and removed from your inventory or chests prior to loading up your save with this version to make for a smoother transition:
 
 - Stove
 - Oven
 - Cooktop
 - Toaster
 - Coffee Maker
 - Microwave
 - Shower Head
 - Shower Glass Mirrors
 - Shower Sliding Glass Doors
 - Toilet Paper
 - Bathroom Towel
 - Closet Pieces
 
 
 WORKABLE KITCHEN APPLIANCES:
 ======
 
 There are now six workable kitchen appliances that work similarly to a campfire. These items are updated from previously static items from UBBI. Now, you can use the Stove, Oven, Cooktop, Toaster, Coffee Maker and Microwave with slightly unique sounds, fuel requirements and even a new tool requirement for the toaster!
 
 
 NEW COOKING TOOL:
 ======
 
 I have created a new tool that can be used in the toaster. The tool in question is a blue tinted spring called a "Shamway Cooking Spring." This tool will allow players to craft the Tuna Fish Gravy Toast at the toaster once the appropriate skills have been met and schematic has been read.
 
 
 NEW POWER/FUEL SOURCES:
 ======
 
 To increase immersion even further, I have put into place the ability to use electronic parts, electric parts and car batteries as a power source with the electronic campfire like appliances. Furthermore, while all items can still be crafted at a campfire, these alternate appliances will look more aesthetic, while allowing players to craft select foods depending on the device.
 
 
 ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS RETURN:
 ======
 
 Similarly to War of the Walkers, I have added the Electronic Components back to the game via not only to the creative menu, but also to the loot list for vehicles, so you should be able to attain these parts as an alternative power source to the kitchen appliances for use to craft foods.
 
 
 SHOWER HEAD FEATURES:
 ======
 
 I have made the shower head usable with water visual and sound effects. To increase immersion and add usefulness to it, I also provided up to 30 minutes of increased benefits, which include inscreased stamina regeneration, icnreased running speed and cold resistance.
 
 
 SHOWER ROOM ITEM TWEAKS & ADDITIONS:
 ======
 
 To improve shower room aesthetics, I have replaced the towel, made the toilet paper piece to be closer to the edge for aesthetics with a toilet, created an alternate toilet paper piece to be closer to the opposite side (left), redesigned the bathroom mirrors and bathroom double doors and created a new bathroom single door as well.
 
 
 CLOSET PIECES TWEAKS & ADDITIONS:
 ======
 
 I have reworked the closet pieces slightly, created a single closet door and created a secret closet door that takes up one block for people playing with one block crouch.
 
 
 NEW CHIMNEY & DOORBELL:
 ======
 
 Inspired by the POI version of the vanilla chimney, I have brought to life a more immersive version of the Chimney with new chimney effects that emit more realistically.
 
 I have added a working doorbell that can not only be used as aesthetics, but it can be used as a way to alarm a player you're entering their build and it will hopefully alarm zombies to some extent as well.
 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 
 - UPDATE 3.0.0 -
 ==============
 
 INSTALL/UPDATE REQUIREMENTS:
 ======
 
 Since this update is designed for Alpha 20.3 compatibility, a new game is recommended for players using the old version of UBBI. If this is your first time playing with UBBI, you should be able to seemlessly install this mod into your game's mod folder.
 
 Testing with overhauls has not been made and will not be. Using UBBI with an overhaul is at your discretion.
 
 
 WHAT'S REMOVED:
 ======
 
 UI elements have been removed. This will allow for quicker updates in the future and better compatibility with overhauls and UI modlets such as the widely popular and personally supported SMX series. I have stripped the Stove, Oven, Cooktop, Toaster, Coffe Maker and Microwave to being purely aesthetic now.
 
 I have removed sound files, UI images and other select Unity files to clean ths mod, as they were no longer needed. I have also adjusted blocks.xml, items.xml, localization.txt and recipes.xml per these changes. I made sure to remove the loot.xml as well, as that is no longer needed.
 
 I completely removed electronic components and the "Shamway Cooking Spring." These were only in the game for the working appliances. Simultaneously, I have removed the ability to use car batteries, electric parts and electronic components as fuel sources in the same vain.
 
 
 WHAT'S ADDED:
 ======
 
 I have enabled storage options for all items that makes sense, such as cabinets, bathroom items and others. This was accomplished by changing one line in blocks.xml for each item and adding an additional line as needed.
