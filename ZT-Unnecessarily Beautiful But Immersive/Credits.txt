 ================================
 
 
 The Fun Pimps: I have appropriated the chimney from the vanilla files, which was originally titled Chimney (POI).
 
 Kenney Assets: I want to say thank you to Kenney.nl for their free assets. I utilized their smoke affect for the new update of UBBI for a Chimney I appropriated from the vanilla files!

 3DHaupt: I want to say thank you to 3DHaupt based out of Ilmenau Germany. Without him, I would not have been able to make my updated version of the microwave more immersive. I took a disc out of a Microwave model created by him. Find his models here: https://sketchfab.com/dennish2010
 
 Unity Assets Store: I want to say thank you to Rivermill Studios for such great shower effects, sound effects and model. I only used the effects, but this was such a great purchase!

 Agustín Hönnun: I want to say thank you to Agustín Hönnun for his Towel and Towel Rail model. I used this free model entirely as a replacement to the towel in Hernan's original Unnecessary But Beautiful modlet.
 
 Guppycur: Thank you for redesigning the closet door for me and making a details video to help me learn what I had done wrong. While I didn't end up using this version in the final release, it helped me bring my closet pieces and closet doors to such a more immersive state.
