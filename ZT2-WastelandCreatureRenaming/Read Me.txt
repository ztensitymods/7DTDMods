 Wasteland Creature Renaming - Version 1.0.0
 An A19.3 Patch That Renames Raiders, Soldiers & Zombies
 Ztensity's Creature Renaming Modlet Series
 
 
 ABOUT THIS MOD
 ==============
 
 Wasteland Creature Renaming is a renaming modlet that corrects creature names for humans and zombies added by Bdubyah's modlet "The Wasteland." Modlets like these are useful, if not necessary for immersion when using a health bar such as Sirillionâ€™s SMX Series and it's optional Target Health Bar modlet, Khaine's HP Bars or KonradSB's Hit Bar Health Bar.
 
 
 REQUIREMENTS
 =======
 
 Most builds of 7 Days to Die  should be acceptable, however the most recent build of the game is recommended, which is currently v19.3.
 
 You will however absolutely require a health bar mod in order for this mod to make an effect on your game, otherwise you simply won't see the changes. You will have to pick one of three health bars currently available by mod authors Sirillion, Khaine and KonradSB.

 To have the same UI, health bar, etc. as found in this modlet's showcase images, you must install Sirillion's SMX series and the accompanying Target Health Bar that is an optional download either through the launcher or via Nexus.
 
 In order for the affects of this modlet to do anything, you must have Bdubyah's modlet "The Wasteland" installed. On Nexus there is an A19 version that includes weapons, raiders, zombies, POIs and more and an A18 version that just includes weapons, so you will need the A19 version!
 
 Select POIs have been added and/or adjusted by Bdubyah in "The Wasteland." Therefore, a new save is required for the full effects of his modlet to take affect. "Wasteland Creature Renaming" should be able to be downloaded alongside "The Wasteland" regardless of a new save or not, but players should pay attention to Bdubyah's guidelines.

 FEATURES
 =======
 
 All humans needing renamed from name type similar to "humanRaiderScoutSMG" have been replaced with an immersive counterpart and all zombies needing renamed from name type similar to "mutantSM1melee1" have also been replaced with an immersive counterpart.
 
 In total, there are about 10-12 variants of raiders, soldiers, mutants and sleeper version that have all been renamed so that when using Bdubyah's "The Wasteland" and a health bar modlet, creatures have appropriate and immersive names.
 
 This now makes "The Wasteland" go very well with other modlets such as Xyth's Creature Pack series and Mumpfy's zombie pack.

 NOTES
 =======
 
 I plan to eventually work on renaming modlets for Xyth's Community Project "1-NPCPackAnimals," "1-NPCPackHumans" and "1-NPCPackMechs." However, due to complications currently with sphereii's "NPC Dialog Windows" and "0-SpherellCore," I put my experimental modlets on the backburner. 
 
 Mod author sphereii has stated that a planned update for both "winterween" and "0-SpherellCore" is in the works to hopefully be pushed by A19.3. For now, I will wait for that update to be released before tackling renaming NPCs of any kind.
 
 
 SHOUT OUTS
 =======
 
 If it wasn't for discussion, guidance and help getting started from other mod authors in Guppy's Discord like wrathmaniac, TSPBX, Xyth, Mumpfy, sphereii, Sirillion, saminal, Khaine, chiko and Guppy himself, none of this would have been possible.
