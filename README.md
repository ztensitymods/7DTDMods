 Official repository for Ztensity's 7 Days to Die Modlets
 ================================
 
 Currently, the repository includes nine different mods that I have created so far. At this point in my modding career, I have learned to work with Read Me's, Localization's, XML's (blocks, items, progression, recipes and sounds), XPATH, Unity, animations and using PNG icons for an ItemIconAtlas.

 Ztensity's Creature Renaming Modlet Series
 =======
 
 The first five modlets focus on localizing names for various creatures around the world space of 7 Days to Die, which includes zombies, animals, humans and machines. I have patches for renaming vanilla creatures, Xyth's various creatures and Mumpfy's zombies.

 Ztensity's Shotgun Messiah Mechs
 =======
 
 The sixth renaming modlet is an add-on for Xyth's "Creature Pack Mechs" and does a lot more than just renaming. Not only does this modlet rename six mechs, but it also doubles the health for select bots, making them bosses. 
 
 As one of the next iterations of what was previously titled "Creature Pack Mechs Renaming," Shoutgun Messiah Mechs seeks to establish new lore surrounding six mechs that were commissioned by the titan company, Shotgun Messiah, months before the zombie apocalyse.
 
 I will first plan to work on implementing a way to make all, some combination or very specific mechs to spawn at the Shotgun Messiah Factories and/or Shotgun Messiah shops (SGM Bee, Rogue Messiah Bot and maybe Messiah's Mecha Claw as examples). If successful, I will then begin implementing quests that would go well with the lore created for the mechs.

 Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive 1.2.7 (Standard Version)
 =======
 
 The remaining two modlets are different versions of a rebuild of Hernan's Unnecessary But Beautiful mod, titled Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive. UBBI for short not only brings the mod up to date and reworks it, but truly overhauls it as well. 
 
 With UBBI, every item, recipe and recipe description has been localized, including the on/off switch wording! Players now also have the ability to turn on/off lights, TVs, a PC, a laptop, a fireplace and a sound bar with a wire tool, as long as they have attained Intellect perk lvl 5 and Advanced Engineering lvl 3. Players can unlock lights early by finding the "Basics of Electricity Schematic" and they can now even utilize the garden bed, small bed and big bed as a bedroll.
 
 Players can place UBBI in most load orders, as it's compatible with almost all modlets. As far as overhauls go, it is currently tested to be 100% compatible with Ravenhearst and War3zuk. Feel free to play with any overhaul or any combination of modlets, just know that as far as overhauls go, until I test it, I cannot give a personal guarantee of success.

 ZT-UBBI GMC 1.2.7 (Gnamod Compatibility Version)
 =======
 
 While both modlets are complete versions of the latest build, ZT-UBBI GMC is designed for compatibility with Gnamod and should only be downloaded for use with the Gnamod overhaul. This alternate modlet was necessary because various vanilla recipes were removed and select recipes were added. Therefore, a tweaked blocks XML and recipes XML was created to work with Gnamod.
 
 The recipes that have been changed are: short iron pipe, wood, scrap polymers, clay soil, forged steel, cloth fragments and glass block. Gnamod uses: iron pipe, sawed wood, plastic scraps, clay, forged iron (different file), forged steel (different file), cloth scraps and glass.
