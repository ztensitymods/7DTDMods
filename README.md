 Official repository for Ztensity's 7 Days to Die Modlets
 ================================
 
 Currently, the repository includes nine different mods that I have created so far. At this point in my modding career, I have learned to work with Read Me's, Localization's, XML's (blocks, items, progression, recipes and sounds), XPATH, Unity, animations and using PNG icons for an ItemIconAtlas.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Ztensity's Creature Renaming Series
 =======
 
 The first five modlets focus on localizing names for various creatures around the world space of 7 Days to Die, which includes zombies, animals, humans and machines. I have patches for renaming vanilla creatures, Xyth's various creatures and Mumpfy's zombies.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Ztensity's Shotgun Messiah Mechs 1.0.0
 =======
 
 The sixth renaming modlet is an add-on for Xyth's "Creature Pack Mechs" and does a lot more than just renaming. Not only does this modlet rename six mechs, but it also doubles the health for select bots, making them bosses. 
 
 As one of the next iterations of what was previously titled "Creature Pack Mechs Renaming," Shoutgun Messiah Mechs seeks to establish new lore surrounding six mechs that were commissioned by the titan company, Shotgun Messiah months before the zombie apocalyse.
 
 I will first plan to work on implementing a way to make all, some combination or very specific mechs to spawn at the Shotgun Messiah Factories and/or Shotgun Messiah shops (SGM Bee, Rogue Messiah Bot and maybe Messiah's Mecha Claw as examples). I will later begin implementing quests that would go well with the lore created for the mechs.

 Ztensity's Wasteland Creature Renaming 1.0.0
 =======
 
 "Wasteland Creature Renaming" is a renaming modlet that corrects creature names for humans and zombies added by Bdubyah's modlet "The Wasteland."
 
 After six different patches that renamed creatures from Vanilla and Xyth's Creature Pack series to Mumpfy's Zombie Pack, I am now releasing this next iteration in the series by request of swmeek. With the intent to continue increasing immersion when encountering different creatures in game, this patch is now publicly available! 
 
 Modlets like these are useful, if not necessary for immersion when using a health bar such as Sirillionâ€™s SMX Series and it's optional Target Health Bar modlet, Khaine's HP Bars or KonradSB's Hit Bar Health Bar. 
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive 1.3.0 (Standard Version)
 =======
 
 The other two UBBI modlets are different versions of a rebuild of Hernan's Unnecessary But Beautiful mod, titled Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive. UBBI for short not only brings the mod up to date and reworks it, but overhauls it as well.
 
 With UBBI, every item, recipe and recipe description has been localized, including the on/off switch wording! Players now also have the ability to turn on/off lights, TVs, a PC, a laptop, a fireplace and a sound bar with a wire tool, as long as they have attained Intellect perk lvl 5 and Advanced Engineering lvl 3. Players can unlock lights early by finding the "Basics of Electricity Schematic" and they can now even utilize the garden bed, a small bed and a big bed as a bedroll.
 
 Players can place UBBI in most load orders, as it's compatible with almost all modlets. As far as overhauls go, it is currently tested to be 100% compatible with Ravenhearst and War3zuk. Feel free to play with any overhaul or any combination of modlets, just know that as far as overhauls go, until I test it, I cannot give a personal guarantee of success.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 ZT-UBBI GMC 1.3.0 (Gnamod Compatibility Version)
 =======
 
 While all three modlets are complete versions of the latest build, ZT-UBBI GMC is designed for compatibility with Gnamod and should only be downloaded for use with the Gnamod overhaul. This alternate modlet was necessary because various vanilla recipes were removed and select recipes were added. Therefore, a tweaked blocks XML and recipes XML was created to work with Gnamod.
 
 The recipes that have been changed are: short iron pipe, wood, scrap polymers, clay soil, forged steel, cloth fragments and glass block. Gnamod uses: iron pipe, sawed wood, plastic scraps, clay, forged iron (different file), forged steel (different file), cloth scraps and glass.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 ZT-UBBI WOTW 1.3.0 (War of the Walkers Compatibility Version)
 =======
 
 While all three modlets are complete versions of the latest build, ZT-UBBI WOTW is designed specifically and only for Dwallorde's mod overhaul titled "War of the Walkers" or WotW for short.
 
 In the WotW compatibility version of UBBI, quite a lot of things changed behind the scenes. From adjusting the perk requirements to work with an entirely different progression system and utilizing three different workbenches for crafting the recipes to Localization tweaks, added resource requirements for crafting select recipes and more, this is truly a fresh and new experience for those who enjoy UBBI.
 
 
 ================================ 
 
 ZT-SMX UI Tweaks 1.0.0
 =======
 
 SMX UI Tweaks is a patch that removes the backsplash behind the inventory toolbelt hud element, removes the toolbelt numbers under the toolbelt, removes the compass backsplash, removes the SMX logo from the menu and from in-game and removes the hud time counter and backsplash behind the hud time counter in the game menus for better immersion while playing with Sirillion's fantastic UI overhaul series.
