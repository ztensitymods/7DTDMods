# 7DTDMods
 Official repository for Ztensity's 7 Days to Die Modlets
 ================================
 
 This repository includes all  mods that I have created for A20. In this repository, you will find five different mods.
 
 
 A19 mods left behind on Nexus:
 =======
 Ztensity's Wasteland Creature Renaming
 Ztensity's Shotgun Messiah Mechs
 Ztensity's Creature Renaming (Animal, Zombie, Human, Mechs - Xyth & Mumpfy)
 Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive SMX Patch
 Ztensity's SMX UI Tweaks
 ZT-PP SMX
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Ztensity's Vanilla Creature Renaming
 =======
 
 Vanilla Creature Renaming is a renaming modlet that corrects vanilla creature names when using a health bar such as Sirillionâ€™s SMX Series and it's optional Target Health Bar modlet, Khaine's HP Bars or KonradSB's Hit Bar Health Bar to name a few.
 
 All animals, zombies and machines missed by The Fun Pimps were added. Some names are rewriting names for personal preference. Every creature in this mod renamed is in the vanilla gameplay. No additional modlet or mod overhaul is necessary. At the same time, this modlet should be compatible with any other modlet, modlet combination or mod overhaul of your choice.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Ztensity's Controller UI Tweaks
 =======
 
 Controller UI Tweaks is inspired by SMX UI Tweaks, but now patches the vanilla UI by removing the LB and RB popups from the in-game menu hud that come up while using a controller and also removes the gamepad callouts from the in-game menu hud that also come up while using a controller.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Ztensity's Functional Elevator
 =======
 
 Originally designed for Alpha 18 by Guppycur, the "Working Elevator" received its next iteration during A19.4. Similarly to the original mod, this elevator only moves from one floor to the next across roughly 2 flights, while also taking up 3 blocks width, 7 blocks high and 3 blocks deep (x,y,z).
 
 Many things have been changed and added to make this fully functioning and more immersive.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Ztensity's Paintings & Posters
 =======
 
 Paintings & Posters works off Snufkin's work on his mod "Paintings_Posters." With his permission, I have expanded this mod to have 50 items total between paintings and posters for either crafting purposes or purchasing puposes.
 
 To coincide with what's added, a quest is attached associated with finding seven books, which will teach players how to create these paintings and posters.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive
 =======
 
 Unnecessarily Beautiful But Immersive is a new edition of Hernan's Unnecessary But Beautiful mod that was originally released on December 19th, 2019. After multiple updates, this is the latest version with a collection of the best features yet!
 
 
 Crafting:

 All items from UBBI can be crafted at a workbench. To craft any lights, players must first have their Intellect perk at lvl six and their Advanced Engineering perk at lvl three. Alternatively, players can find the "Basics of Electricity Schematic" at a trader or in the world to unlock the lights early.

 Players can use the wrench line of tools to receive additional resources when destroying most of the items, while also receiving a small number of resources back when using just fists and/or weapons to destroy them instead.

 Players can repair items crafted by using specific sources from cloth fragments, wood and glass blocks to forged iron, concrete mix and leather.


 Lights & Technology:

 All lights, TVs, a PC, laptop, fireplace, sound bar, doorbell and shower head must be turned on by using a wire tool.

 The shower head is usable with water visuals and sound effects. To increase immersion and add usefulness to it, the shower provides up to 30 minutes of increased benefits, which include increased stamina regeneration, increased
 running speed and cold resistance.

 The doorbell and sound bar have specific sounds, which may alert zombies and other players in multiplayer nearby.


 Miscellaneous Additions:

 The garden bed, small bed and big bed can be used as a bedroll.

 There is a single closet door and a secret closet door that takes up one block for people playing with one block crouch.

 Inspired by the POI version of the vanilla chimney, a new altered Chimney can be placed with new chimney effects that emits smoke more realistically.

 Storage options are now a feature attached to almost all cabinets, select bathroom items and others like a fridge.
