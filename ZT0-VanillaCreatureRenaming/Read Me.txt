 Vanilla Creature Renaming - Version 2.0.0
 Select A20.3 Patches That Rename Zombies, Animals, Machines & More!
 
 
 ABOUT THIS MOD
 ==============
 
 Vanilla Creature Renaming is a renaming modlet that corrects vanilla creature names when using a health bar such as Sirillionâ€™s SMX Series and it's optional Target Health Bar modlet, Khaine's HP Bars or KonradSB's Hit Bar Health Bar to name a few.
 
 
 REQUIREMENTS
 =======
 
 This modlet is now designed for Alpha 20.3, keeping in mind all changes made by Fun Pimps.
 
 You will require a health bar mod in order for this mod to have an effect on your game, otherwise you simply won't see the changes. You will have to pick one of the health bars available from mod authors Sirillion, Khaine and KonradSB.

 To have the same UI, health bar, etc. as found in this modlet's showcase images, you must install Sirillion's SMX series and the accompanying Target Health Bar that is an optional download either through the launcher or via Nexus.

 FEATURES
 =======
 
 All animals needing renamed from name type similar to "animalZombieBear" have been replaced with an immersive counterpart and all zombies needing renamed from name type similar to "zombieJoeRadiated" have also been replaced with an immersive counterpart.

 SHOUT OUTS
 =======
 
 If it wasn't for discussion, guidance and help getting started from other mod authors in Guppy's Discord like wrathmaniac, TSPBX, Xyth, Mumpfy, sphereii, Sirillion, saminal, Khaine, chiko and Guppy himself, my first mod here would not have been possible.

 wrathmaniac: Thank you for some of your suggestions for v1.3's Localization edits for my animal pack and zombie pack from Xyth's creations! This helped me edit 36 zombies with your ideas in mind in the zombie pack and it helped me edit two animals in the animal creature pack. To add to this, I realized an animal needed removed from this pack since it belonged only in Xyth's pack!
 
 CREDITS
 =======
 
 None of Xyth's Creature Packs would be possible either if it wasn't for the hard work and communication of this powerful modding community. 
 
 Primarily, I want to give an extra thank you to not only Xyth, but also DarkStarDragon, Guppycur and TSBX for work on the zombies, Robeloto for work on Spider sounds, Mumpfy for work on re-texturing and new asset creation, and XML work by Kergan, SaltyAF and Chikorina (Chiko).
 
 Most importantly, thank you to The Fun Pimps for continuing to update 7 Days to Die and making very good improvements and additions to Alpha 20.3!
