 Vanilla Creature Renaming - Version 1.2.1
 Select A19.3 Patches That Rename Zombies, Animals, Machines & More!
 
 
 ABOUT THIS MOD
 ==============
 
 Vanilla Creature Renaming is a renaming modlet that corrects vanilla creature names when using a health bar such as Sirillionâ€™s SMX Series and it's optional Target Health Bar modlet, Khaine's HP Bars or KonradSB's Hit Bar Health Bar.
 
 
 REQUIREMENTS
 =======
 
 Most builds of 7 Days to Die  should be acceptable, however the most recent build of the game is recommended, which is currently v19.3.
 
 You will however absolutely require a health bar mod in order for this mod to make an effect on your game, otherwise you simply won't see the changes. You will have to pick one of three health bars currently available by mod authors Sirillion, Khaine and KonradSB.

 To have the same UI, health bar, etc. as found in this modlet's showcase images, you must install Sirillion's SMX series and the accompanying Target Health Bar that is an optional download either through the launcher or via Nexus.

 FEATURES
 =======
 
 All animals needing renamed from name type similar to "animalZombieBear" have been replaced with an immersive counterpart and all zombies needing renamed from name type similar to "zombieJoeRadiated" have also been replaced with an immersive counterpart.
 
 Two turrets have been renamed from similar incorrect name types to more immersive counterparts. Select zombies have been renamed for a fresh experience and to increase immersiveness, while at the same time select animals have been renamed for a fresh experience and to increase immersiveness as well.

 THIS MODLET CONTAINS VANILLA CHANGES ONLY
 =======
 
 Every creature in this mod renamed is in the vanilla gameplay. No additional modlet or mod overhaul is necessary. At the same time, this modlet should be compatible with any other modlet, modlet combination or mod overhaul of your choice. However, I do have additional modlets that rename creatures added by five other mods by Xyth and Mumpfy.
 
 
 MY OTHER RENAMING MODLETS
 =======
 
 Additional creatures are renamed through five other modlets that are dependent on "recommended creature mods" below. My additional modlets are titled:

 - ZT1-CreaturePackZombieNames
 - ZT1-CreaturePackHumanNames
 - ZT1-CreaturePackAnimalNames
 - ZT1-CreaturePackMechNames
 - ZT1-HDMumpfySkinsZombieNames

 You can find all my additional modlets here: http://bit.ly/38pnCsq

 NOTES
 =======
 
 I plan to eventually work on renaming modlets for Xyth's Community Project "1-NPCPackAnimals," "1-NPCPackHumans" and "1-NPCPackMechs." However, due to complications currently with sphereii's "NPC Dialog Windows" and "0-SpherellCore," I put my experimental modlets on the backburner. 
 
 Mod author sphereii has stated that a planned update for both "winterween" and "0-SpherellCore" is in the works to hopefully be pushed by A19.3. For now, I will wait for that update to be released before tackling renaming NPCs of any kind.
 
 
 SHOUT OUTS
 =======
 
 If it wasn't for discussion, guidance and help getting started from other mod authors in Guppy's Discord like wrathmaniac, TSPBX, Xyth, Mumpfy, sphereii, Sirillion, saminal, Khaine, chiko and Guppy himself, none of this would have been possible.

 wrathmaniac: Thank you for some of your suggestions for v1.3's Localization edits for my animal pack and zombie pack from Xyth's creations! This helped me edit 36 zombies with your ideas in mind in the zombie pack and it helped me edit two animals in the animal creature pack. To add to this, I realized an animal needed removed from this pack since it belonged only in Xyth's pack!
 
 CREDITS
 =======
 
 None of Xyth's Creature Packs would be possible either if it wasn't for the hard work and communication of this powerful modding community. 
 
 Primarily, I want to give an extra thank you to not only Xyth, but also DarkStarDragon, Guppycur and TSBX for work on the zombies, Robeloto for work on Spider sounds, Mumpfy for work on re-texturing and new asset creation, and XML work by Kergan, SaltyAF and Chikorina (Chiko).
