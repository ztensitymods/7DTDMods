 ENTITYCLASSES XML ADDITION:

 An entityclasses.xml has been added, which adjusts the HP levels of mechRobotArmy from 400 to 800 and the mechSphereIIMech from 500 to 900. This was done to rename them with boss names.
 
 
 LORE CREATION:
 ======
 
 The beginning of lore has been created for the mech's that were originally created by Xyth and the community project. The idea is that the titan company, Shotgun Messiah, commissioned an assortment of these six various mechs as a last resort to protect their company, their assets and maybe their people. It clearly failed amidst the final months before the apocalypse, but they tried.
 
 This idea came to mind as Shotgun Messiah is one of the only POIs in the game with a factory big enough to potentially house some of them and it gave me the idea that maybe they were a rich company.
