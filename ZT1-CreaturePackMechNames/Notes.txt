 XPATH "@" SYMBOL:
 ======
 
 Take the following XPATH for an example:
 
 <set xpath="//entity_class[@name='mechSphereII']/effect_group/passive_effect[@name='HealthMax' and @operation='base_set']/@value">900</set>
 
 Attributes receive an "@" before them in the line, meanwhile "nodes" or main code like "effect_group" or "passive_effect" do not need an "@" symbol before them in the line.
 
 
 XPATH GENERAL EFFECTS VS SPECIFIC EFFECTS:
 ------------
 
 Take the following XPATH for an example:
 
 <set xpath="//entity_class[@name='mechSphereII']/effect_group/passive_effect/@value">900</set>
 
 This xpath will change the value of all passive effects in the group, since it does not look for a specific one by a name attribute or something. If someone where to add another effect before it, that would mess stuff up.
 
 The // tells it to look at every node rather than starting at a more specific point.
 
 Therefore, changing that XPATH to what is below will make it cleaner, more precise, shorter and most importantly less prone to error and if something breaks, you'll know it's not a bug:
 
 <set xpath="//entity_class[@name='mechSphereII']/effect_group/passive_effect[@name='HealthMax' and @operation='base_set']/@value">900</set>
 
 
 MISCELLANIOUS XPATH NOTES:
 ------------
 
 <set xpath="//effect_group[@name='Base Effects']/.."></set>
 
 Is a way you could use it as well, this would hit all entities that have an effect group with the name Base Effects.

 (the .. is blanks since I did not want to write an entire xpath).
 
 
 MISCELLANIOUS XPATH NOTES:
 ------------
 
 <remove xpath="//property"/>
 
 This would remove all <property/> nodes.
 
 
 MISCELLANIOUS XPATH NOTES:
 ------------
 
 <remove xpath="/entity/property"/>
 
 This would only remove properties in entities.
 
 
 XPATH FOOD FOR THOUGHT:
 ------------
 
 XPATH is like making path to a file in folders (where the folders are nodes and the files are attributes.
 
 
 MISCELLANIOUS XPATH NOTES:
 ------------
 
 Consider:
 
 <block name="woodPole">
    <property name="Extends" value="woodMaster"/>
    <property name="Shape" value="New"/>
    <property name="LightOpacity" value="0"/>
    <property name="Model" value="pole_square"/>
    <property name="Collide" value="movement,melee,bullet,arrow,rocket"/>
    <property name="SortOrder2" value="0780"/> <!-- SortShape -->
    <property name="ImposterExclude" value="true"/>
    <property name="ImposterDontBlock" value="true"/>
    <property name="UseGlobalUV" value="Local"/>
    <property class="UpgradeBlock">
        <property name="ToBlock" value="rWoodPole"/>
        <property name="ItemCount" value="8"/>
    </property>
    <drop event="Fall" count="0" prob="0"/>
    <property name="Group" value="Building,advBuilding"/>
 </block>

 And wanting to change all upgrade on all blocks to use 16 items instead of 8
 
 <set xpath="//property[@name='ItemCount']">16</set>
 
 Or wanting only to set those with value 8 to 16
 
 <set xpath="//property[@name='ItemCount' and @value='8']">16</set>
 
 This is why xpath wins from manual editing, since it can do quite specific but still bulk changes to stuff with just 1 line of code.
 
 Though you always need to check if you do not hit something else, ItemCount could be used in other places that you do not want to affect.
 
 
 TAKING NOTES USING <!-- --> IN XML:
 ------------ 
 
 You cannot use <!-- --> within a node declaration or it will Spaatz out
 
 For Example:
 
 <configs>
	daysAliveChangeWhenKilled="2"
	difficultyBonus="1.2"
	startingWeight ="1"
	diminishingReturns ="0.5"
		
	<!-- Dont add comments here -->

	lootBonusEvery = "12"
	lootBonusMaxCount = "30"
	lootBonusScale = "25"
 </configs>
