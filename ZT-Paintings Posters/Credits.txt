 Ztensity's Paintings & Posters - Version 1.1.0
 Reworking Snufkin's Paintings & Posters 19.4
 Credits
 
 ================================
 
 
 A portion of assets and coding was originally designed by Snufkin's. However, with his permission I have re-designed the modlet with so much more content. Snufkin's assets included 20 paintings and 20 posters from UNITY3D bundles, 40 icons and two XML files as a starting point (blocks.xml and blockplaceholders.xml).
 
 Credit is also due to the following artists for using art they designed as pictures for the new paintings:
