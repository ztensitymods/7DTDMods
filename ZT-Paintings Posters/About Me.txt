 Ztensity's Paintings & Posters - Version 1.1.0
 Reworking Snufkin's Paintings & Posters 19.4
 
 
 ABOUT THIS MOD
 =======
 
 Originally created by Snufkin, "Paintings_Posters" is now getting a heavy re-work for Nexus Mods, 7 Days to Die Forums and the 7 Days to Die Mod Launcher. Originally containing 20 posters and 20 paintings that can be found across the game at random, the modlet now does so much more as "Ztensity's Paintings & Posters."
 
 This rework of "Paintings_Posters" contains the following additions:
 
 
 1. There are now nine separate recipes that can be crafted at the workbench, which allow players to make all paintings and posters to put them for display.
 
 2. In order to craft each recipe, players must first find seven separate books from the newly added "Paintings & Posters" collection. With each book read, a different set of paintings or posters will be unlocked for crafting purposes. Once all seven books are read, the player will unlock paintings or posters from the last book and a secret set of paintings along with it.
 
 3. There are are a total of ten new paintings added by this mod in addition to Snufkin's previously designed paintings and posters. While seven of the new paintings can be crafted once unlocked, three more rare paintings can only be bought from a trader.
 
 4. There is a light designed to put above paintings and posters for aesthetic and immersive purposes.
 
 5. Every painting and poster has been re-designed for consistency, descriptions have been added for learning purposes, aesthetics and a bit of realism, and icons have been tweaked for further immersion.
 
 
 In total, there are 50 items that are being added for either crafting purposes or purchasing purposes. Once this modlet is implmented into a game-save, the journey to find all seven books begins!

 REQUIREMENTS
 =======
 
 Paintings & Posters is a modlet that should be compatible with A19 entirely and most likely earlier alpha builds as well. There are no specific requirements to implement this mod into a game-save.
 
 There is an optional modlet that adjusts an icon for better immersion alongside Sirillion's UI overhaul series, SMX. If you are a player who is using Sirillion's SMX, make sure to get that optional file.
 
 This modlet is likely incompatible with select overhauls that adjusts skill books, the perk system or elements of the UI. However, I am open to designing a compatibility fix if prompted, as it should be relatively easy to implement for this mod.

 WHAT FILES ARE NEW
 =======
 
 While Snufkin already provided a blocks.xml for all paintings and posters, a blockplaceholders.xml for the blocks to be randomly distributed throughout the world-space, two UNITY3D files for paintings and posters, and 40 icons for items added, I have actually added quite a bit of new files.
 
 First and foremost, I designed eight different Unity files and icons for those new items based on Snufkin's work. This did require a bit of editing on both fronts, but it makes this mod more original then ever.
 
 I designed seven different book covers and one UI icon for the book collection skill, which allows players to craft the recipes once read. This is to match vanilla and increase immersion.
 
 I have inserted new code into the blocks.xml to provide master blocks for recipes and new paintings. I also adjusted pre-existing code to match what I was wanting to do. I have added an actual recipes.xml to provide the ability to craft almost all paintings and posters solely through 9 different recipes.
 
 I have adjusted a light from UBBI for Paintings & Posters and added it to blocks.xml, recipes.xml, progression.xml and Localization for immersive and aesthetic purposes.
 
 I have added an items.xml, which adds in the seven books into the game. To go along this, I also created a progression.xml file, which sets up the book/perk system for unlocking the paintings and posters.
 
 I have added a loot.xml and traders.xml to make sure that the books will not only be placed around the world-space, but will also be available for purchase at the traders. Players will also be able to buy one new painting exclusively from a trader.
 
 Finally, I have a hefty Localization.txt file, which rings in everything making this modlet through and through look immersive, streamlined, cleaned etc. from new perks, books, paintings, posters, descriptions, titles and so on.

 FUTURE UPDATES
 =======
 
 Over time, I may expand on this modlet to add new paintings, new recipes, new unlockable features and so on.
 
 Specifically, for instance, I'm already thinking about ideas for Halloween 2021.

 CREDITS
 =======
 
 A portion of assets and coding was originally designed by Snufkin. However, with his permission I have re-designed the modlet with so much more content. Snufkin's assets included 20 paintings and 20 posters from UNITY3D bundles, 40 icons and two XML files as a starting point (blocks.xml and blockplaceholders.xml).
