 Ztensity's Functional Elevator - Version 1.0.0
 Redesigning Guppycur's Elevator for 19.3
 
 
 ABOUT THIS MOD
 =======
 
 Originally designed for Alpha 18 by Guppycur, the "Working Elevator" gets its next iteration for the latest build of 7 Days to Die. Similarly to the original mod, this elevator only moves from one floor to the next across roughly 2 flights, while also taking up 3 blocks width, 7 blocks high and 3 blocks deep (x,y,z).
 
 This iteration of the elevator contains the following tweaks & new features:
 
 
 1. I fixed the starting state so that when placed it'll be in the closed position.
 
 2. I made the elevator door open positions slightly longer (3-4 seconds roughly), so its easier to get in and out.
 
 3. I have thinned out the elevator just slightly to fit perfectly in the space you put it in.
 
 4. I have added sound effects, visual effects and additional animations for immersion.
 
 5. I have added additional colliders to prevent the player from accidentally falling out.
 
 6. I have added an official recipe with resource requirements for crafting it at the workbench.
 
 7. I have added a way to salvage the elevator using a wrench to get a portion of your materials back at random.
 
 8. I have added Localization text for the title and description.
 
 9. I removed the prefab data from this modlet for simplicity.
 
 
 Coincidentally, adding the colliders and thinning out the elevator also makes it so the player does not have to worry too much about building right next to the elevator. All in all, these features and tweaks make for a more immersive experience that is more fun than ever.
 
 
 ================================
 
 
 REQUIREMENTS
 =======
 
 As detailed by Guppycur, the shaft requirements are actually 10 blocks high (including floor and ceiling), 5 blocks wide (1 and 5 are the left right walls) and 5 blocks deep (1 and 5 are the front/rear walls). Think about it like x,y,z. This will be made even easier if the elevator is just placed first and then you build around it.
 
 For building purposes, use the horizontal plates (concrete or otherwise) and select advanzed rotations. Then rotate the plate so it's against a block. Use these plates with standard sized 1x1x1 blocks to build the shaft for the elevator.
 
 Finally, just as the original version, if a player is still using Alpha 17, Alpha 18 or earlier versions of Alpha 19, this should still be compatible with those versions. However, this modlet has been designed for compatibility with 7 Days to Die's latest stable, which is currently Alpha 19.3b6.

 WHAT FILES ARE NEW
 =======
 
 To make all these changes necessary, I have created a new UNITY3D file in the resources folder to include a new version of the elevator with all the new features and tweaks. 
 
 I have reduced the modlet size by only having a UIAtlases->ItemIconAtlas folder heirachy that holds the "Elevator" icon image. To this end, I also adjusted the blocks.xml with tweaked lines and added lines to make the icon appear as intended.
 
 I have added a recipes.xml file so the Elevator will be added to the Workbench for availabl crafting purposes with a set amount of required resources, 10 minutes instead of the default 24+ minutes for crafting time and an added line to the blocks.xml which adds the Elevator to the correct groups.
 
 I have added a sounds.xml file to create a "silent" sound for the blocks.xml code so that when pressing y/e/triangle to open the door you don't hear anything except for the custom animations created for the elevator itself.

 FUTURE UPDATES
 =======
 
 In the coming weeks to months, I may expand on this modlet as a series of "rising devices" as suggested by Guppycur himself.
 
 The next update I'd likely implement however, would be adding in a similar elevator that will take you up three flights or higher.
 
 My ideas would be focused on the hotel POIs, so players could even make a massive hotel a home using devices like elevators, escalators and so on.

 CREDITS
 =======
 
 All assets used come from a purchased package from Nifty Studios via Unity. On the other hand, a portion of the animations designed and layout of the elevators was put together by Guppycur when he originally bought the assets for A18.
 
 Not only did I get permission to rework and re-release Guppycur's work on animations and the elevator layout from Guppycur himself, but I made sure to purchase those same assets again myself for rights to share this modlet on Nexus Mods, the Forums and the 7 Days to Die Mod Launcher.
