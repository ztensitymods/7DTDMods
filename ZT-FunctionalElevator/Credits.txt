 Ztensity's Functional Elevator - Version 1.0.0
 Redesigning Guppycur's Elevator for 19.3
 Credits
 
 ================================
 
 
 All assets used come from a purchased package from Nifty Studios via Unity. On the other hand, a portion of the animations designed and layout of the elevators was put together by Guppycur when he originally bought the assets for A18.
 
 Not only did I get permission to rework and re-release Guppycur's work on animations and the elevator layout from Guppycur himself, but I made sure to purchase those same assets again myself for rights to share this modlet on Nexus Mods, the Forums and the 7 Days to Die Mod Launcher.
