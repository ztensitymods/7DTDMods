 Custom Perks Renaming - Version 1.0.1
 Zuzul0l's 19.1, Custom Perks: Prestige Skills
 Perk Title & Description Tweaks
 
 
 ABOUT THIS MOD
 ==============
 
 One of the staples in my load order is mod author's Zuzul0l's Custom Perks: Prestige Skills. The modlet adds up to fifty new perks in an extra tab for spending points on. A mod that not only makes the long game last that much longer, but it also can give a lot more variety into a players game.
 
 After using this mod for a while, I discovered that there was an issue with the UI title next to "Perks & Attributes" and "Perk Books." Instead of being titled "Prestige Skills" as pointed out on Nexus and in the progressions.xml, it was showing "attprestige."
 
 What this mod does is localize and rename "attprestige" to a more appropriate name that players will see in-game as "Prestige Perks."
 
 
 REQUIREMENTS
 =======
 
 A player must use versions 19.1 through versions 19.3 of 7 Days to Die. The modlet states it's designed for alpha version 19.1, but it works seamlessly with the latest stable, 19.3.
 
 In order for this modlet to work and/or do anything at all, you must have Zuzul0l's "Custom Perks - Prestige Skills A19.1" version 3.01 installed.

 If you enjoy using Sirillion's SMX series and/or his accompanying Target Health Bar, there is an alternative main version available for download titled "Custom Perks - Prestige Skills A19.1 SMX" version 3.01 that you can install for similar appearances as shown in all my showcases.

 NOTES
 =======
 
 I may eventually take a closer look, to correct any kind of grammar, as I'm a writer and I really like this mod and if you use any of my modlets, you know that I go for immersion. For now, however, I am sticking with this simple Localization, am focusing on UBBI, releasing a 7D2D Mod Launcher tutorial and getting all my mods onto the 7D2D Mod Launcher.
 
 
 SHOUT OUTS
 =======
 
 Thank you Haidr'Gna for helping me figure out the crux with this one. Without you, I would not have realized that the Localization required "attPrestige" to be in all lowercase as "attprestige" in order to change the naming to "Prestige Perks."
 
 Thank you icedsun for providing me with the progression.xml XPATH code to change the description key of perkArmorSpecialist so that the Localization could be tweaked more efficiently.
 
 
 CREDITS
 =======
 
 Thank you Zuzul0l for all your hard work on your fantastic mod "Custom Perks: Prestige Skills"! It's very much appreciated and I love having it in my load order. I created this modlet only as a patch to increase immersion when playing the game with my friends!
