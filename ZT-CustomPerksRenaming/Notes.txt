 LOCALIZATION ESCAPE CHAR FOR QUOTES TO CHANGE PERK DESCRIPTION:
 ======
 
 Mod author Adreden shared that anytime a "comma" is included somewhere such as a desc_key, you can use quotation marks in the Localization to rename it.
 
 For example:
 ------------
 
 In progressions.xml you'll have - 
 
 <perk name="perkArmorSpecialist" parent="attPrestige" name_key="Armor Specialist" desc_key="Your armor feels like a second skin an thus is even more durable now. (In addition to the corresponding armor perk, the last rank will nullify all damage to armor)." icon="cp_armorspecialist">
 
 
 To change this in Localization.txt -
 
 Your armor feels like a second skin an thus is even more durable now. (In addition to the corresponding armor perk, the last rank will nullify all damage to armor).
 
 
 You must change it to this -
 
 "Your armor feels like a second skin an thus is even more durable now. (In addition to the corresponding armor perk"," the last rank will nullify all damage to armor)."
 
 
 Using this fix is a workaround to correct a Localization when a word or description in XML is using quotes or commas.
 
 
 The final result would look like this for this particular Localization:
 ------------
 
 "Your armor feels like a second skin an thus is even more durable now. (In addition to the corresponding armor perk"," the last rank will nullify all damage to armor).",progression,perk Str,Your armor feels like a second skin and thus is even more durable now. Once warn enough you'll nullify all damage to armor!
 
 
 USING PROGRESSION.XML, XPATH & LOCALIZATION TO CHANGE PERK DESCRIPTION:
 ======
 
 To change the original desc_key of this perk that had a comma in it from the original progressions.xml -
 
 <perk name="perkArmorSpecialist" parent="attPrestige" name_key="Armor Specialist" desc_key="Your armor feels like a second skin an thus is even more durable now. (In addition to the corresponding armor perk, the last rank will nullify all damage to armor)." icon="cp_armorspecialist">
 
 
 You must use a progression.xml file and XPATH to change the desc_key title like so - 
 
 <set xpath="/progression/perks/perk[@name='perkArmorSpecialist']/@desc_key">armorSpecialistDesc</set>
 
 
 Once this is created, your Localization will look like this - 
 
 armorSpecialistDesc,progression,perk Str,Your armor feels like a second skin and thus is even more durable now. Once warn enough you'll nullify all damage to armor!
 
 
 This is much more efficient and allows for less errors and better consistency.
